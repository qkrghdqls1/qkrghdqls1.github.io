    description: >
      We propose a more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor decomposition methods.
      Our approach, leveraging the Six-axis and CP decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency,
      and reconstruction/localization quality.
